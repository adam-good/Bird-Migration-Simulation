# Bird Migration Simulation

## NOTICE:
This was an old project from college. I noticed it's getting some attention now so I wanted to let people know it should probably be rewritten. It likely isn't useful to researchers as it is.

A tool for simulating bird migration for mathematical/biological research.

Details will be added as the tool becomes more usable.
